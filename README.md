Every Sudoku has a unique solution that can be reached logically.  Players will have to select a number from the number palette below and click a blank space in the game board so that each row, column and 3x3 box contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repeats. If the player makes a move that is not allowed, the conflicting cells will be highlighted red and the player will not be able to make any other moves until the error is removed. Successfully complete the game to be added to the scoreboard.
