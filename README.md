The Sudoku game is preloaded with a game board. Players will have to select a number from the number palette below and a cell in the game board to place digits. Hovering over a cell will highlight the cell. If the player makes a move that is not allowed, the conflicting cells will be highlighted red and the player will not be able to make any other moves until the error is removed.
